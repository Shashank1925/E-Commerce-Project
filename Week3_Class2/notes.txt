Running from the Local File System:

Cause: If you are running the HTML file directly from the local file system (e.g., by opening the HTML file in a browser using file://), the fetch API may not work properly due to browser security restrictions (CORS issues or restrictions on fetching files from file://).

Solution:

Use a Local Server: Serve your files using a local development server rather than opening the HTML file directly in your browser. You can use Python, Node.js, or any simple HTTP server.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running a local server is a straightforward way to serve your files and avoid issues like those caused by accessing files directly with the file:// protocol. Hereâ€™s how you can set up a simple local server using different methods, depending on your environment.

1. Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server
Python provides a built-in module to start an HTTP server, which is very easy to use.

Python 3.x:
Navigate to your project directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and change to the directory containing your product_page.html and products.json files.

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Start the server: Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m http.server
This will start a local server on port 8000 by default.

Access your site: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. Your HTML files will be served from the current directory.

If you need to specify a different port, use:

bash
Copy code
python -m http.server 8080
And access it via http://localhost:8080.
